## About

This Command Line Interface (CLI) App that was built as part of the coursework for CZ2001: Object Oriented Programming and Design. This app is built on JAVA, taking OOP principles into account.

This app contains basic reservation and Resturant Point-Of-Sale (POS) features such as:

* Menus (Add/Modify/Remove) + Create customizable meal package using the menu items.
* Making/Cancelling Reservations
* Check-In Reservations
* Invoice Generation
* Staff/Membership Details
* Sales Report Generation
* Mimic Read/Write Operations to database using CSV files

This project was done in colloboration with my fellow teammates:
Arnav, Aarushi, Peng Aik and Joel. 

## Stored Data

There are a few CSV files that have benn used for Read/Write operations that are used to mimic the transactions that occur to a standard DBMS. 

* activeOrders.csv -> There is currently 1 active order for your reference (this will not be removed till you check out)

* orderReservations.csv -> There is currently 1 active reservation (due to the 1 active order). Added reservations will appear here

* orderInvoices.csv -> There is currently only 1 invoice here, since there was only 1 customer that has checked-out

* menu, promotionPackage, membership list, staff list and Restaurant csv files  have been populated for your convenience.
If you do need access to this original csv files, you can visit the github repo here:
